            <h2>Origin of Chess</h2>

            <h3>Chess, a timeless game of strategy and 
            intellect, traces its origins back to the 
            6th century in northern India, where it 
            was known as Chaturanga. This early version 
            of the game mirrored the four divisions of 
            the Indian military: infantry, cavalry, 
            elephantry, and chariotry, represented by 
            pieces that would evolve into the pawns, 
            knights, bishops, and rooks we know today. 
            The game spread to Persia, where it was 
            called Shatranj, and from there it traveled 
            to the Islamic world and eventually Europe. 
            By the 15th century, chess had transformed 
            into the modern game, reflecting the cultural 
            and intellectual exchange across civilizations. 
            Today, chess continues to captivate millions, 
            from casual players to grandmasters, with its 
            rich history and endless possibilities for 
            strategic depth.</h3>
